# Generalized agilemarkdown work-gate (cwd-independent).
#
# A Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Edit/Write/NotebookEdit that enforces the
# Pivotal rule "no code changes without a pulled story" for ANY am-managed
# repo — regardless of which directory the agent session was launched from.
# (The per-repo started-story-gate only fires when the session runs from
# that repo; this one keys off the edited file's path instead, so it works
# globally from ~/.claude/settings.json.)
#
# Decision:
#   - Not an Edit/Write/NotebookEdit          -> allow
#   - Edited file is not inside an am repo     -> allow (non-am project)
#   - Edited file is backlog / agent infra     -> allow (managing the work)
#   - The repo has >=1 story in `started`      -> allow
#   - Otherwise                                -> BLOCK (exit 2)
#
# An am repo is identified by a `.am/` directory at its root; its stories
# live in the directory containing `_priority.md` (root or a sub-folder).
